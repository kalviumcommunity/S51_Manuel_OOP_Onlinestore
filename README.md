# Online Lipstick Store

This project demonstrates a simple online lipstick store using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C++. 
The application allows users to add, list, and search for lipsticks in the store's inventory.

## Features

- **Add Lipstick**: Add new lipstick items to the inventory.
- **List Lipsticks**: View all lipsticks available in the inventory.
- **Search Lipstick**: Search for lipsticks by brand or color.

## OOP Concepts Applied

- **Classes and Objects**: `Lipstick`, `Inventory`, `Store`
- **Encapsulation**: Private member variables with public methods for accessing and modifying them.
- **Abstraction**: `Store` class provides a simple interface for interacting with the inventory.
- **Polymorphism**: Demonstrated with virtual functions, can be extended in future enhancements.
